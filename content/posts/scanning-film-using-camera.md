I recently came across an old used micro Nikkor lens. Those are known to be a great choice for scanning film in the film photography community. This lens turned out to be a game changer in my film scanning workflow, producing outstanding scans in even higher resolution.

## Old micro Nikkor lenses
Nikkor lenses produced around the 1980's are commonly used for film scanning because of their superb optic quality and relatively high avalaibility (used). They were intended for film cameras, but can be mounted directly to nikon DSLRs thanks to the F mount.

## My scanning setup
- Sony A6000 camera
- Sony-E to Nikon-F adapter
- [Nikon 55mm f/2.8 AF MICRO-NIKKOR](https://kenrockwell.com/nikon/55af.htm)
- [Cinestill Cs-lite light](https://medium.com/@robinferand/seeing-is-believing-how-the-cinestill-cs-lite-light-source-can-improve-your-film-scanning-9d042cb8ea5e)
- A 3D printed film holder

Camera mounting is extremely important. Most people mount their camera onto a copy stand to scan film lain horizontally. Copy stands are, however, extremely expensive. In my case, a copy stand would probably double the cost of the entire setup, including my camera. This is why I chose to use a 3D printed film holder to hold the film in place vertically, which allows me to scan it without needing to use a copy stand.

### Film carrier

A film carrier holds your film in place and allows you to move your film after scanning each frame. You can 3D print a perfectly working film carrier at virtually no cost. On the other hand, some companies offer premium film carriers that do the same job, but are more rigid and will probably last longer.
