I recently came across an old used micro Nikkor lens. Those are known to be a great choice for scanning film in the film photography community. This lens turned out to be a game changer in my film scanning workflow, producing outstanding scans in even higher resolution.

## Old micro Nikkor lenses
Nikkor lenses produced around the 1980's are commonly used for film scanning because of their superb optic quality and relatively high avalaibility (used). They were intended for film cameras, but can be mounted directly to nikon DSLRs thanks to the F mount.

## Scanning setup
My scanning setup consists of:
- Sony A6000 camera
- Sony-E to Nikon-F adapter
- Nikon 55mm f/2.8 AF MICRO-NIKKOR
- Cinestill Cs-lite light
- A 3D printed film holder
